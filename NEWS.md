# viraldomain 0.0.6

* Data sets adjustments

# viraldomain 0.0.5

* Added a NEWS.md file to track changes to the package.

# viraldomain 0.0.4

## Major changes

* Included `viral` and `sero` datasets for testing and demonstrating package functionality.

* Implemented `knn_domain_score` function for calculating domain applicability scores based on K-Nearest Neighbor models.

* Implemented `mars_domain_score` function for calculating domain applicability scores based on Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines models.

* Implemented `nn_domain_score` function for calculating domain applicability scores based on Neural Network models.

* Implemented `simple_domain_plot` function to generate a domain plot for a simple model based on PCA distances. This function provides a visual representation of the domain applicability for the given data.

* Implemented `rf_domain_score` function for calculating domain applicability scores based on Random Forest models.

* Implemented `normalized_domain_plot` function to generate a domain plot for a normalized model based on PCA distances.
